 * Base class of every inventory action.

 * Everything an inventory trigger does (crafting, placing shulkers, breaking them, ...) needs several ticks and
 * several server round trips, so every action is a small state machine that gets ticked once per client tick and
 * reports back whether it is still running. Doing all of it inside a single tick either dead locks the client or
 * desyncs the inventory.
